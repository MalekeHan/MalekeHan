# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Maleke Hanson and I am currently a computer science student at University of San Francisco.

I am interested in full stack development and enjoy working on projects that involve both front-end and back-end development. I am constantly learning and growing my skills, and am always looking for new challenges to tackle.

## Skills

Here are some of the programming languages and technologies that I have experience with:

- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- React
- C#
- NET Core
- Ocaml
- HMTL/CSS

I am always open to learning and working with new technologies, so feel free to reach out if you have a project that you think I would be a good fit for.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I hope you find my projects interesting and informative.

Sincerely,
Maleke
